        "description": "<div>Ted Chiang's first published story, \"<i>Tower of Babylon</i>,\" won the Nebula Award in 1990. Subsequent stories have won the Asimov's SF Magazine reader poll, a second Nebula Award, the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award, and the Sidewise Award for alternate history. He won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 1992. Story for story, he is the most honored young writer in modern SF.<br /><br />Now, collected here for the first time are all seven of this extraordinary writer's stories so far-plus an eighth story written especially for this volume.<br /><br />What if men built a tower from Earth to Heaven-and broke through to Heaven's other side? What if we discovered that the fundamentals of mathematics were arbitrary and inconsistent? What if there were a science of naming things that calls life into being from inanimate matter? What if exposure to an alien language forever changed our perception of time? What if all the beliefs of fundamentalist Christianity were literally true, and the sight of sinners being swallowed into fiery pits were a routine event on city streets? These are the kinds of outrageous questions posed by the stories of Ted Chiang. Stories of your life . . . and others.<br /></div>",

In \"<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223379.The_Merchant_and_the_Alchemist_s_Gate\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  <i>The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate</i>\n</a>,\" a portal through time forces a fabric seller in ancient Baghdad to grapple with past mistakes and the temptation of second chances. In the epistolary \"<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48588075-exhalation\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  <i>Exhalation</i>\n</a>,\" an alien scientist makes a shocking discovery with ramifications not just for his own people, but for all of reality. And in \"<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7886338-the-lifecycle-of-software-objects\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  <i>The Lifecycle of Software Objects</i>\n</a>,\" a woman cares for an artificial intelligence over twenty years, elevating a faddish digital pet into what might be a true living being. Also included are two brand-new stories: \"<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53128694-omphalos\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  <i>Omphalos</i>\n</a>\" and \"<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53128611-anxiety-is-the-dizziness-of-freedom\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  <i>Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom</i>\n</a>.\"<br /><br />In this fantastical and elegant collection, Ted Chiang wrestles with the oldest questions on earth—What is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human?—and ones that no one else has even imagined. And, each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and compassion.",

        "description": "What's the best way to create artificial intelligence? In 1950, Alan Turing wrote, \"Many people think that a very abstract activity, like the playing of chess, would be best. It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. This process could follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc. Again I do not know what the right answer is, but I think both approaches should be tried.\"<p><br />The first approach has been tried many times in both science fiction and reality. In this new novella, at over 30,000 words, his longest work to date, Ted Chiang offers a detailed imagining of how the second approach might work within the contemporary landscape of startup companies, massively-multiplayer online gaming, and open-source software. It's a story of two people and the artificial intelligences they helped create, following them for more than a decade as they deal with the upgrades and obsolescence that are inevitable in the world of software. At the same time, it's an examination of the difference between processing power and intelligence, and of what it means to have a real relationship with an artificial entity.</p>",

It begins with a walk in the bazaar, but soon grows into a tale unlike any other told in the caliph's empire. It's a story that includes not just buried treasure and a band of thieves, but also men haunted by their past and others trapped by their future; it includes not just a beloved wife and a veiled seductress, but also long journeys taken by caravan and even longer ones taken with a single step. Above all, it's a story about recognizing the will of Allah and accepting it, no matter what form it takes.",

        "description": "A Vintage Shorts “Short Story Month” Selection<br />  <br /> Together with a crew of other miners and cart-pullers, Hillalum is recruited to climb the Tower of Babylon and unearth what lies beyond the vault of heaven. During his journey, Hillalum discovers entire civilizations of tower-dwellers on the tower—there are those who live inside the mists of clouds, those who raise their vegetables above the sun, and those who have spent their lives under the oppressive weight of an endless, white stratum at the top of the universe.<br />  <br /> “Tower of Babylon” is a rare gem—a winner of the prestigious Nebula award, the first story Ted Chiang ever published, and the brilliant opening piece to Chiang’s much-lauded first collection, <i>Stories of Your Life and Others</i>, which is soon to be a major motion picture starring Amy Adams. <br />  <br /> An eBook short.",

From Hugo and Nebula winners to Pulitzer and Booker Prize finalists to New York Times bestsellers, this anthology collects 30 pieces of Subterranean’s best, representing diverse, breathtaking short fiction from today’s modern masters.<br /><br />In “<i>Last Breath</i>” Joe Hill spins the tale of a man who collects the breaths of the dying for his haunting museum. Catherynne M. Valente’s “<i>White Lines on a Green Field</i>” chronicles what might happen if Coyote became a small town high school quarterback. Karen Joy Fowler’s “<i>Younger Women</i>” finds a woman confronting her daughter’s new boyfriend, who happens to be a vampire. Visit the Twilight Zone via George R.R. Martin in the script “<i>The Toys of Caliban</i>”. In Ted Chiang’s “<i>The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling</i>” the narratives of a journalist and a young man are told in contrast, both impacted by technology and literacy. And in Kelley Armstrong’s “<i>The Screams of Dragons</i>” a boy is declared a changeling and things only get stranger from there. Other pieces visit far-flung space and intimate sick rooms, the futuristic pyramids of the rich and a jungle where a man-eating tiger stalks a village.<br /><br />Contents:<br />- <i>Perfidia</i> (2004) by Lewis Shiner<br />- <i>Game</i> (2012) by Maria Dahvana Headley<br />- <i>The Last Log of the Lachrimosa</i> (2014) by Alastair Reynolds<br />- <i>The Seventeenth Kind</i> (2007) by Michael Marshall Smith<br />- <i>Dispersed by the Sun, Melting in the Wind</i> (2007) by Rachel Swirsky<br />- <i>The Pile</i> (2008) by Michael Bishop<br />- <i>The Bohemian Astrobleme</i> (2010) by Kage Baker<br />- <i>Tanglefoot</i> (2008) by Cherie Priest<br />- <i>Hide and Horns</i> (2009) by Joe R.

        "description": "\"Ted Chiang’s very short story, 'The Great Silence' adds another set of questions to the Fermi Paradox speculations. Why, he asks, are we so interested in finding intelligence in the stars and so deaf to the many species who manifest it here on earth? And also: why have we demanded that, as proof of intelligence, non-human animals communicate to us in human language, and then dismissed those creatures that actually do so?\" - Karen Joy Fowler <br /> <br />About the Author: Ted Chiang was born in Port Jefferson, New York, and holds a degree in computer science. In 1989 he attended the Clarion Science Fiction and Fantasy Writer’s Workshop. His fiction has won four Hugo, four Nebula, and four Locus awards, and he is the recipient of the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer and the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award. Stories of Your Life and Others has been translated into ten languages. He lives near Seattle, Washington. <br /> <br />About the Guest Editor: Karen Joy Fowler is the author of six novels and three short story collections. The Jane Austen Book Club spent thirteen weeks on the New York Times bestsellers list and was a New York Times Notable Book.

        "description": "Something exciting has been happening in modern SF. After decades of confusion, many of the field's best writers have been returning to the subgenre called, roughly, \"hard SF\" - science fiction focused on science and technology, often with strong adventure plots. Now, World Fantasy Award-winning editors David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer present an immense, authoritative anthology that maps the development and modern-day resurgence of this form, argues for its special virtues and present preeminence - and entertains us with some spectacular storytelling along the way. <br />Included are major stories by contemporary and classic names such as Poul Anderson, Stephen Baxter, Gregory Benford, Ben Bova, David Brin, Arthur C. Clarke, Hal Clement, Greg Egan, Joe Haldeman, Nancy Kress, Paul McAuley, Frederik Pohl, Alastair Reynolds, Kim Stanley Robinson, Robert J. Sawyer, Karl Schroeder, Charles Sheffield, Brian Stableford, Allen Steele, Bruce Sterling, Michael Swanwick, and Vernor Vinge. <br />\"The Hard SF Renaissance\" will be an anthology that SF readers return to for years to come.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Gene Wars (1991) by Paul J.

        "description": "If it is true that the test of a first-rate mind is its ability to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time, then we live in a century when it takes a first-rate mind just to get through the day. We have unprecedented access to information; cognitive dissonance is a banner headline in our morning papers and radiates silently from our computer screens. Slipstream, poised between literature and popular culture, embraces the dissonance. <br /><br />These ambitious stories of visionary strangeness defy the conventions of science fiction. Tales by Michael Chabon, Karen Joy Fowler, Jonathan Lethem, Carol Emshwiller, George Saunders, and others pull the reader into a vivid dreamspace and embrace the knowledge that life today is increasingly surreal. <br /><br />Contents<br /><br />Introduction by John Kessel and Jim Patrick Kelly<br /><br />\"Al\" by Carol Emshwiller <br />\"The Little Magic Shop\" by Bruce Sterling <br />\"The Healer\" by Aimee Bender <br />\"The Specialist's Hat\" by Kelly Link <br />\"Light and the Sufferer\" by Jonathan Lethem <br />\"Sea Oak\" by George Saunders <br />\"Exhibit H: Torn Pages Discovered in the Vest Pocket of an Unidentified Tourist\" by Jeff VanderMeer <br />\"Hell is the Absence of God\" by Ted Chiang <br />\"Lieserl\" by Karen Joy Fowler <br />\"Bright Morning\" by Jeffrey Ford <br />Biographical Notes to \"A Discourse on the Nature of Causality, with Air-planes\" by Benjamin Rosenbaum <br />\"The God of Dark Laughter\" by Michael Chabon <br />\"The Rose in Twelve Petals\" by Theodora Goss <br />\"The Lions Are Asleep This Night\" by Howard Waldrop <br />\"You Have Never Been Here\" by M.

        "description": "This new edition of Brian Aldiss' classic anthology brings together a diverse selection of science fiction spanning over sixty years, from Isaac Asimov's \"Nightfall\", first published in 1941, to the 2006 story \"Friends in Need\" by Eliza Blair. Including authors such as Clifford Simak, Harry Harrison, Bruce Sterling, A. E. Van Vogt and Brian Aldiss himself, these stories portray struggles against machines, epic journeys, genetic experiments, time travellers and alien races. From stories set on Earth, to uncanny far distant worlds and ancient burnt-out suns, the one constant is humanity itself, compelled by an often fatal curiosity to explore the boundless frontiers of time, space and probability.<br /><br />Thirty short stories and a novella, first published in Penguin Modern Classics November 2007 with a cover illustration by Jim Burns. The new stories are:<br /><br />• James Tiptree, Jr : And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill's Side<br />• Bruce Sterling : Swarm<br />• Greg Bear : Blood Music<br />• Fredric Brown : Answer<br />• Kim Stanley Robinson : Sexual Dimorphism<br />• Eliza Blair : Friends in Need<br />• James Inglis : Night Watch<br />• Ted Chiang : Story of Your Life<br />• Garry Kilworth : Alien Embassy<br />• John Crowley : Great Work of Time",

How can we prevent prettyheaded behavior in our own world?<br /><br />In <i>Extras</i>, the last book in Scott Westerfeld’s Uglies series, Aya tells us that when Tally Youngblood made the mind-rain fall, it cured all the pretties and changed the world forever. But Tally and her friends did more than change their world; they changed ours too.<br /><br /><i>Mind-Rain</i> continues what Tally started, with startling, funny and insightful essays on the world, characters and ideas of the Uglies series, plus the short story that inspired Westerfeld to write the books in the first place.<br /><br />Think you know everything about Tally’s world? After <i>Mind-Rain</i>, you’ll never look at the Uglies series the same way again.<br />",

In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF--and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales.<br /><br />This month, We have a pair of connected fantasy stories by husband-and-wife creative duo J.T. Petty and Sarah Langan (\"Family Teeth, Part 5: American Jackal\" and \"Family Teeth, Part 6: St. Polycarp's Home for Happy Wanderers\"), along with fantasy reprints by Brian Evenson (\"An Accounting\") and Kelly Link (\"Catskin\"). Plus, we have original science fiction by D. Thomas Minton (\"Dreams in Dust\") and Ken Liu (\"The Perfect Match\"), and SF reprints by Yoon Ha Lee (\"Swanwatch\") and Marta Randall (\"Lazaro y Antonio\"). For our ebook readers, our ebook-exclusive novella is \"Story of Your Life\" by Ted Chiang, and of course we have our usual assortment of author and artist spotlights, along with feature interviews with bestseller Tad Williams and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot Diaz. Plus, we have an excerpt of the new Dresden Files novel, Cold Days, by Jim Butcher.",

To światowa prapremiera.<br />Drugie wydanie zbioru opowiadań Teda Chianga, najwybitniejszego autora opowiadań w amerykańskiej SF ostatnich lat.<br />Praktycznie każde jego opowiadanie – a publikuje ich niewiele, czasem tylko jedno rocznie – jest wydarzeniem literackim. Jego teksty zdobywają też liczne nagrody.<br />Zbiór „Siedemdziesiąt dwie litery” zawiera wszystkie opowiadania Chianga, jakie opublikował od początku swojej kariery. Zbiór oparto na wydaniu „Historii twojego życia”, znakomicie przyjętej w Polsce książki, zawiera jednak dwa dodatkowe opowiadania (oba nagrodzone) – a jedno z nich nigdy nie zostało w Polsce opublikowane.<br />Zawartość zbioru:<br /><br /> * „Wieża Babilonu”<br /> * „Zrozum”<br /> * „Dzielenie przez zero”<br /> * „Historia twojego życia”<br /> * „72 litery”<br /> * „Ewolucja ludzkiej nauki”<br /> * „Piekło to nieobecność Boga”<br /> * „Co ma cieszyć oczy”<br /> * „Co z nami będzie”<br /> * „Kupiec i wrota alchemika”<br /> * „Wydech”",
