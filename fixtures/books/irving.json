        "description": "Eleven-year-old Owen Meany, playing in a Little League baseball game in Gravesend, New Hampshire, hits a foul ball and kills his best friend's mother. Owen doesn't believe in accidents; he believes he is God's instrument. What happens to Owen after that 1953 foul is both extraordinary and terrifying. At moments a comic, self-deluded victim, but in the end the principal, tragic actor in a divine plan, Owen Meany is the most heartbreaking hero John Irving has yet created.",

        "description": "This is the life and times of T. S. Garp, the bastard son of Jenny Fields—a feminist leader ahead of her times. This is the life and death of a famous mother and her almost-famous son; theirs is a world of sexual extremes—even of sexual assassinations. It is a novel rich with \"lunacy and sorrow\"; yet the dark, violent events of the story do not undermine a comedy both ribald and robust. In more than thirty languages, in more than forty countries—with more than ten million copies in print—this novel provides almost cheerful, even hilarious evidence of its famous last line: \"In the world according to Garp, we are all terminal cases.\"",

Hoteliers, pet-bear owners, friends of Freud (the animal trainer and vaudevillian, that is), and playthings of mad fate, they “dream on” in a funny, sad, outrageous, and moving novel by the remarkable author of A Prayer for Owen Meany and Last Night in Twisted River.",

        "description": "“One night when she was four and sleeping in the bottom bunk of her bunk bed, Ruth Cole woke to the sound of lovemaking—it was coming from her parents’ bedroom.”<br /><br />This sentence opens John Irving’s ninth novel, A Widow for One Year, a story of a family marked by tragedy. Ruth Cole is a complex, often self-contradictory character—a “difficult” woman. By no means is she conventionally “nice,” but she will never be forgotten.<br /><br />Ruth’s story is told in three parts, each focusing on a critical time in her life. When we first meet her—on Long Island, in the summer of 1958—Ruth is only four.<br /><br />The second window into Ruth’s life opens on the fall of 1990, when she is an unmarried woman whose personal life is not nearly as successful as her literary career. She distrusts her judgment in men, for good reason.<br /><br />A Widow for One Year closes in the autumn of 1995, when Ruth Cole is a forty-one-year-old widow and mother. She’s about to fall in love for the first time.<br /><br />Richly comic, as well as deeply disturbing, A Widow for One Year is a multilayered love story of astonishing emotional force. Both ribald and erotic, it is also a brilliant novel about the passage of time and the relentlessness of grief.<br />Source: john-irving.com",

Billy, the bisexual narrator and main character of <i>In One Person</i>, tells the tragicomic story (lasting more than half a century) of his life as a \"sexual suspect,\" a phrase first used by John Irving in 1978 in his landmark novel of \"terminal cases,\" <i>The World According to Garp</i>.<br /><br /><i>In One Person</i> is a poignant tribute to Billy’s friends and lovers—a theatrical cast of characters who defy category and convention. Not least, <i>In One Person</i> is an intimate and unforgettable portrait of the solitariness of a bisexual man who is dedicated to making himself \"worthwhile.",

        "description": "In 1954, in the cookhouse of a logging and sawmill settlement in northern New Hampshire, an anxious twelve-year-old boy mistakes the local constable’s girlfriend for a bear. Both the twelve-year-old and his father become fugitives, forced to run from Coos County–to Boston, to southern Vermont, to Toronto–pursued by the implacable constable. Their lone protector is a fiercely libertarian logger, once a river driver, who befriends them.<br /><br />In a story spanning five decades, <b>Last Night in Twisted River</b>–John Irving’s twelfth novel–depicts the recent half-century in the United States as “a living replica of Coos County, where lethal hatreds were generally permitted to run their course.” From the novel’s taut opening sentence–“The young Canadian, who could not have been more than fifteen, had hesitated too long”–to its elegiac final chapter, <b>Last Night in Twisted River</b> is written with the historical authenticity and emotional authority of <b>The Cider House Rules</b> and A <b>Prayer for Owen Meany.</b> It is also as violent and disturbing a story as John Irving’s breakthrough bestseller, <b>The World According to Garp.</b><br /><br />What further distinguishes <b>Last Night in Twisted River</b> is the author’s unmistakable voice–the inimitable voice of an accomplished storyteller. Near the end of this moving novel, John Irving writes: “We don’t always have a choice how we get to know one another. Sometimes, people fall into our lives cleanly–as if out of the sky, or as if there were a direct flight from Heaven to Earth–the same sudden way we lose people, who once seemed they would always be part of our lives.”",

        "description": "John Irving returns to the themes that established him as one of our most admired and beloved authors in this absorbing novel of fate and memory.<br />As we grow older—most of all, in what we remember and what we dream—we live in the past. Sometimes, we live more vividly in the past than in the present.<br /><br />As an older man, Juan Diego will take a trip to the Philippines, but what travels with him are his dreams and memories; he is most alive in his childhood and early adolescence in Mexico. “An aura of fate had marked him,” John Irving writes, of Juan Diego. “The chain of events, the links in our lives—what leads us where we’re going, the courses we follow to our ends, what we don’t see coming, and what we do—all this can be mysterious, or simply unseen, or even obvious.”<br /><br /><i>Avenue of Mysteries</i> is the story of what happens to Juan Diego in the Philippines, where what happened to him in the past—in Mexico—collides with his future.",

        "description": "Dedicated to the memory of two wrestling coaches and two writer friends, <i>The Imaginary Girlfriend</i> is John Irving's candid memoir of his twin careers in writing and wrestling. The award-winning author of best-selling novels from <i>The World According to Garp</i> to <i>In One Person</i>, Irving began writing when he was fourteen, the same age at which he began to wrestle at Exeter. He competed as a wrestler for twenty years, was certified as a referee at twenty-four, and coached the sport until he was forty-seven. Irving coached his sons Colin and Brendan to New England championship titles, a championship that he himself was denied.<br /><br />In an autobiography filled with the humor and compassion one finds in his fiction, Irving explores the interrelationship between the two disciplines of writing and wrestling, from the days when he was a beginner at both until his fourth wresting related surgery at the age of fifty-three. Writing as a father and mentor, he offers a lucid portrait of those—writers and wrestlers from Kurt Vonnegut to Ted Seabrooke—who played a mentor role in his development as a novelist, wrestler, and wrestling coach. He reveals lessons he learned about the pursuit for which he is best known, writing. “And,” as the Denver Post observed, in filling “his narrative with anecdotes that are every bit as hilarious as the antics in his novels, Irving combines the lessons of both obsessions (wrestling and writing) . . . into a somber reflection on the importance of living well.”",

But <i>My Movie Business</i> focuses primarily on the thirteen years John Irving spent adapting his novel <i>The Cider House Rules</i> for the screen--for four different directors.<br /> <br />Mr. Irving also writes about the failed effort to make his first novel, Setting Free the Bears, into a movie; about two of the films that were made from his novels (but not from his screenplays), <i>The World According to Garp</i> and <i>The Hotel New Hampshire</i>; about his slow progress at shepherding his screenplay of <i>A Son of the Circus</i> into production.<br /> <br />Not least, and in addition to its qualities as a memoir--anecdotal, comic, affectionate, and candid--<i>My Movie Business</i> is an insightful essay on the essential differences between writing a novel and writing a screenplay.<br /><br />The photographs in <i>My Movie Business</i> were taken by Stephen Vaughan, the still photographer on the set of <i>The Cider House Rules</i>--a Miramax production directed by Lasse Hallström, with Michael Caine in the role of Dr. Larch. Concurrently with the November 1999 release of the film, Talk Miramax Books will publish John Irving's screenplay.",

        "description": "This acadamy-award winning screenplay by John Irving was written over a fourteen year period and is the companion screenplay to the Miramax film, co-starring Michael Caine, who won the Acadmy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Dr.Wilbur Larch.The Cider House Rules is set in rural Maine in the first half of this century. It tells the story of Homer Wells, an orphan who is raised and mentored by Wilbur Larch, the doctor at the orphanage. Dr. Larch teaches Homer eveything about medicine. Yet though his capacity for kindness is saintly, Larch is also an ether addict. He and Homer come into conflict, which is typical of many father-son relationships, but in this case, their conflict is intensified by their disagreements about abortion. The result is Homer leaves the only family he has ever known.<br /><br />Homer's new life provides more excitement than he could have imagined, especially when he falls in love for the first time. But, when forced to make decisions that will change the course of his future, Homer finally realizes that he can't escape his past. The Cider House Rules is ultimately about the choices we make and the rules that are meant to be broken.",

It is also the story of Dr. Larch's favorite orphan, Homer Wells, who is never adopted. </p><p>\n  <i>A Widow for One Year</i>\n</p><p>Richly comic, as well as deeply disturbing, <i>A Widow for One Year</i> is a multilayered love story of astonishing emotional force.  Both ribald and erotic, it is also a brilliant novel about the passage of time and the relentlessness of grief. </p><p>\n  <i>A Prayer for Owen Meany</i>\n</p><p>In the summer of 1953, two eleven-year-old boys–best friends–are playing in a Little League baseball game in Gravesend, New Hampshire. One of the boys hits a foul ball that kills the other boy’s mother. The boy who hits the ball doesn’t believe in accidents; Owen Meany believes he is God’s instrument. What happens to Owen, after that 1953 foul ball, is extraordinary and terrifying.</p>",

To help you decide which books are right for your classroom, each free ebook in this series contains a Common Core–aligned teaching guide and a sample chapter.<br /><br />This free teaching guide for <em>A Prayer for Owen Meany</em> by John Irving is designed to help you put the new Common Core State Standards into practice.<br /><br />\"Among the very best American novels of our time.\"—<em>Charlotte Observer</em><br /><br />In the summer of 1953, two eleven-year-old boys—best friends—are playing in a Little League baseball game in Gravesend, New Hampshire. One of the boys hits a foul ball that kills the other boy's mother. The boy who hits the ball doesn't believe in accidents; Owen Meany believes he is God's instrument. What happens to Owen after that 1953 foul ball is extraordinary.",
