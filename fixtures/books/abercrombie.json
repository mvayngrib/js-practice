        "description": "Logen Ninefingers, infamous barbarian, has finally run out of luck. Caught in one feud too many, he’s on the verge of becoming a dead barbarian – leaving nothing behind him but bad songs, dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies. <br /><br />Nobleman Captain Jezal dan Luthar, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules. <br /><br />Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendship. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart of government, if he can stay alive long enough to follow it. <br /><br />Enter the wizard, Bayaz. A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant, he could be the First of the Magi, he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever he is, he's about to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glokta a whole lot more difficult. <br /><br />Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be settled, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood.<br /><br />",

        "description": "Superior Glokta has a problem. How do you defend a city surrounded by enemies and riddled with traitors, when your allies can by no means be trusted, and your predecessor vanished without a trace? It’s enough to make a torturer want to run – if he could even walk without a stick.<br /><br />Northmen have spilled over the border of Angland and are spreading fire and death across the frozen country. Crown Prince Ladisla is poised to drive them back and win undying glory. There is only one problem – he commands the worst-armed, worst-trained, worst-led army in the world.<br /><br />And Bayaz, the First of the Magi, is leading a party of bold adventurers on a perilous mission through the ruins of the past. The most hated woman in the South, the most feared man in the North, and the most selfish boy in the Union make a strange alliance, but a deadly one. They might even stand a chance of saving mankind from the Eaters. If they didn’t hate each other quite so much.<br /><br />Ancient secrets will be uncovered. Bloody battles will be won and lost. Bitter enemies will be forgiven – but not before they are hanged.<br /><br />",

Battle rages across the North, the King of the Northmen still stands firm, and there's only one man who can stop him. His oldest friend, and his oldest enemy. It's past time for the Bloody-Nine to come home. <br /><br />With too many masters and too little time, Superior Glokta is fighting a different kind of war. A secret struggle in which no one is safe, and no one can be trusted. His days with a sword are far behind him. It's a good thing blackmail, threats and torture still work well enough. <br /><br />Jezal dan Luthar has decided that winning glory is far too painful, and turned his back on soldiering for a simple life with the woman he loves. But love can be painful too, and glory has a nasty habit of creeping up on a man when he least expects it. <br /><br />While the King of the Union lies on his deathbead, the peasants revolt and the nobles scramble to steal his crown. No one believes that the shadow of war is falling across the very heart of the Union. The First of the Magi has a plan to save the world, as he always does. But there are risks. There is no risk more terrible, after all, than to break the First Law...<br /><br />",

The ruthless Grand Duke Orso is locked in a vicious struggle with the squabbling League of Eight, and between them they have bled the land white. While armies march, heads roll and cities burn, behind the scenes bankers, priests and older, darker powers play a deadly game to choose who will be king.<br /><br />War may be hell but for Monza Murcatto, the Snake of Talins, the most feared and famous mercenary in Duke Orso's employ, it's a damn good way of making money too. Her victories have made her popular - a shade too popular for her employer's taste. Betrayed, thrown down a mountain and left for dead, Murcatto's reward is a broken body and a burning hunger for vengeance. Whatever the cost, seven men must die.<br /><br />Her allies include Styria's least reliable drunkard, Styria's most treacherous poisoner, a mass-murderer obsessed with numbers and a Northman who just wants to do the right thing. Her enemies number the better half of the nation. And that's all before the most dangerous man in the world is dispatched to hunt her down and finish the job Duke Orso started...<br /><br />Springtime in Styria. And that means revenge.<br /><br />",

        "description": "Thinking man’s barbarian Logen Ninefingers struggles to escape his bloody past, war hero turned torturer Inquisitor Glokta struggles to control the treacherous present, and self-obsessed young nobleman Jezal dan Luthar struggles to snatch a golden future without doing any work at all. All three are drawn into the machinations of Bayaz, the legendary First of the Magi. But does he really want to save the world? Or are things more complicated than they appear?<br /><br />The First Law is a trilogy that combines the best of fantasy – adventure, mystery, magic, and an epic scale – with realism, cynicism, visceral action, plenty of surprises, a focus on vivid characters, and a heavy dose of black humour. Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be settled, bloody battles will be won and lost, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood. Unpredictable, compelling, and wickedly funny, The First Law is noir fantasy with a real cutting edge.<br /><br />The books have sold over 2 million copies and are published in 26 languages, now Blind Ferret bring you a comprehensive, full colour graphic novel of The First Law adapted by Chuck Dixon and edited by Rich Young, with art by Andie Tong, Colors by Pete Pantazis, Letters and Design by Bill Tortolini, and with input and oversight at every stage from Joe Abercrombie.",

Her victories have made her popular - a shade too popular for her employer's taste. Betrayed, thrown down a mountain and left for dead, Murcatto's reward is a broken body and a burning hunger for vengeance. Whatever the cost, seven men must die.</p><p> </p><p> THE HEROES: Over three bloody days of battle, the fate of the North will be decided. But with both sides riddled by intrigues, follies, feuds and petty jealousies, it is unlikely to be the noblest hearts, or even the strongest arms that prevail. Three men. One battle. No Heroes.</p><p> </p><p> RED COUNTRY: Shy South hoped to bury her bloody past and ride away smiling, but she'll have to sharpen up some bad old ways to get her family back, and she's not a woman to flinch from what needs doing. She sets off in pursuit off her family's killers with only a pair of oxen and her cowardly old stepfather Lamb for company. But it turns out Lamb's buried a bloody past of his own, and out in the lawless Far Country, the past never stays buried.</p>",

He’s probably best known for his First Law trilogy, the first novel of which, The Blade Itself, was published in 2006; it was followed in subsequent years by Before They Are Hanged and Last Argument of Kings. He’s also written the stand-alone fantasy novels Best Served Cold and The Heroes. His most recent novel is Red Country. In addition to writing, Abercrombie is also a freelance film editor and lives and works in London.",

        "description": "Discover the fantasy novels that have earned raves from George R. R. Martin and <i>Maze Runner </i>author James Dashner, won a Locus Award and an Alex Award, and claimed best-of-the-year honors in <i>Time, The Washington Post, </i>and <i>BuzzFeed</i>. From a crippled slave whose appearance belies his dangerous ambitions, to “a girl who makes Katniss Everdeen look like Dorothy” (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>), an unforgettable cast of characters populate this addictive series, now together in one epic ebook bundle:<br />  <br /> <b>HALF A KING</b><br /> <b>HALF THE WORLD</b><br /> <b>HALF A WAR</b><br /> <b> </b><br /> Prince Yarvi has vowed to regain a throne he never wanted. But first he must survive cruelty, chains, and the bitter waters of the Shattered Sea. And he must do it all with only one good hand. Born a weakling in the eyes of his father, Yarvi is alone in a world where a strong arm and a cold heart rule. He cannot grip a shield or swing an axe, so he must sharpen his mind to a deadly edge. Gathering a strange fellowship of the outcast and the lost, he finds they can do more to help him become the man he needs to be than any court of nobles could. But even with loyal friends at his side, Yarvi learns that his path may end as it began—in twists, and traps, and tragedy.<br />  <br /> <b>Praise for the Shattered Sea series</b><br />  <br /> “The Shattered Seas trilogy has worked its way into a very exclusive group of my favorite fantasy novels of all time. The pacing is perfect, the characters deep and true and real, the world rich and authentic, the plot full of twists and turns. Perhaps my favorite part is that no one is purely good or evil: Each and every character has layers upon layers that are a joy to discover. I tore through all three books and truly hope that someday Joe Abercrombie returns to this magnificent, captivating world.”<b>—James Dashner, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Maze Runner</i></b><br />  <br /> “A fast-paced tale of betrayal and revenge that grabbed me from page 1 and refused to let go.”<b>—George R. R. Martin</b>, on <i>Half a King</i><br />  <br /> “Abercrombie’s Shattered Sea is a fantastic yet believable backdrop to Yarvi’s struggle, a vivid imaginary land.”<b>\n  <i>—The Seattle Times</i>\n</b>, on <i>Half a King</i><br />  <br /> “An excellent page-turner . . . full of drama and energy.”<b>—New York <i>Daily News</i></b><i>, </i>on <i>Half the World</i><br />  <br /> “Compelling . . . [Thorn] makes Katniss Everdeen look like Dorothy.”<b>—<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><i>, </i>on <i>Half the World</i><br />  <br /> “A fantasy for all ages, and all times, [that] rends the soul as compulsively as anything Abercrombie has written to date . . . <i>Half a War</i> is a success in every way, putting a stupendous capstone on the entire Shattered Sea Trilogy.”<b>—<i>Tor.com</i></b><br />  <br /> “Abercrombie piles on shocking betrayals and charges his characters a high price for vengeance in this powerful and fitting final volume.”<b>—<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><i>, </i>on <i>Half a War</i>",

All types of mythical beasties and villains abound-including vampire assassins stalking the canals of Venice in Jon Courtenay Grimwood's The Fallen Blade, zombie infestations everywhere in Jesse Petersen's Flip this Zombie, and, of course, a mysterious, if somewhat confused, pig in Tom Holt's hilarious Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Sausages. Also, Gail Z. Martin returns to the world of The Summoner in a new series starting with The Sworn. Joe Abercrombie takes us down into the dirt and blood of a battlefield and shows us all the true face of heroism in The Heroes. And, finally, the urban fantasists are back with the new Matthew Swift book from Kate Griffin, The Neon Court, the next entry in Trent Jamieson's Death Works series with Managing Death, Sabina Kane's return in Green-Eyed Demon by Jaye Wells and, a special treat, the entire Dante Valentine series in one volume from Lilith Saintcrow!",

Two new authors, one a newcomer, and the other an eBook favorite in print for the first time: Kristen Painter crafts a gothic story where vampire aristocracy meets urban fantasy action with Blood Rights (with the next two books in the series coming out in consecutive months) and Michael J.
